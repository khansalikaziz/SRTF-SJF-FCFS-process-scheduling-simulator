										<h2>Process Scheduling Algorithms</h2>
										<p>CPU Scheduling</p>
									</header>
									<p>The process of choosing which process will use the CPU while another is waiting is known as CPU scheduling. CPU scheduling's primary responsibility is to make sure that whenever the CPU is idle, the OS at least chooses one of the processes in the ready queue to be executed. The CPU scheduler will conduct the selecting process. One of the processes in memory that is prepared for execution is chosen.</p>

									<h3>Scheduling Algorithms</h3>
									<p>
									Scheduling is the process in computing that assigns tasks to the resources that will complete them. Virtual computing components like threads, processes, or data flows may be used for the work, which is then scheduled onto hardware resources like processors, network links, or expansion cards. The scheduling process is carried out by a scheduler. Schedulers are frequently used to maintain all computer resources active (as in load balancing), properly divide up system resources among different users, or to reach a certain level of service quality. The idea of scheduling makes it inherent to the execution paradigm of a computer system and important to computing itself, is an integral component of a computer system's execution architecture; the idea of scheduling enables computer multitasking with a single central processor unit (CPU). The descriptions of 8 implemented algorithms are provided below.</p>

												<h4>First Come First Serve (FCFS)</h4>
												<p>First Come First Serve is an operating system scheduling algorithm that automatically queues requests and processes in the order they arrive. It is the simplest and simplest CPU scheduling algorithm. In this type of algorithm, the processes that request the CPU first get CPU allocation first. This is managed using a FIFO queue.</p>

												<h4>Shortest Job First (SJF)</h4>
												<p>Shortest job first is a scheduling policy that selects the waiting process with the shortest execution time to execute next. It is a non-preemptive and Greedy algorithm. The shortest job first has the advantage of the minimum average waiting time among all scheduling algorithms. If shorter processes keep coming, it can cause starvation.</p>

												<h4>Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)</h4>
												<p>This algorithm is a preemptive version of SJF scheduling. In SRTF, process execution can be stopped after a certain period of time. As each process arrives, the short-term scheduler schedules the process with the smallest remaining burst time from the list of available processes and the running process.</p>
